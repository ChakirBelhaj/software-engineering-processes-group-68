**Answer:**
Depending on what type of commitment is made we observe that different automated checks are performed. A few automated checks that are seen in almost every commit are ‘CodeQL / Analyze’, ‘Dead Link Checker / linkChecker’ and ‘Docker container test / Container test’. Each of these automated checks test different functionalities or characteristics on the pushed commit. For example, ‘CodeQL / Analyze’ runs GitHub's industry-leading semantic code analysis engine against a repository's source code to find security vulnerabilities. It then automatically uploads the results to GitHub so they can be displayed in the repository's security tab1.
